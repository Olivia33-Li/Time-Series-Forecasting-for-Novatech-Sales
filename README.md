# ðŸ“ˆ CPI Forecasting & Interest Rate Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between Australiaâ€™s Consumer Price Index (CPI) and interest rates, and applies time series forecasting models to predict future CPI trends. It highlights strong data preparation, entry accuracy, and model evaluation practices.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

- **Objective**: Forecast future CPI values and explore how they relate to interest rate trends.
- **Data Sources**:
  - Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) â€“ CPI data
  - Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) â€“ Interest rate data
- **Time Range**: 2005â€“2024 (quarterly data)

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Technologies

- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, prophet
- **Methods**: Time series forecasting, model comparison, data validation, error checking

## ðŸ“Š Project Workflow

### 1. Data Entry & Cleaning
- Loaded CSV data and converted dates into quarterly datetime format
- Checked for and removed duplicate entries
- Ensured data integrity before modeling

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Plotted CPI and interest rate trends over time
- Used seasonal decomposition to analyze patterns
- Investigated correlations between inflation and interest rate shifts

### 3. Model Building
- **Holt-Winters**: Captures seasonal and trend patterns
- **SARIMA**: Used AIC and PACF/ACF to select parameters
- **Prophet**: Deployed Facebook's model for robust time-based prediction

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Applied time series cross-validation using `TimeSeriesSplit`
- Compared models using Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Selected the best model for 12-month CPI forecast

### 5. Visualization
- Generated line plots with forecasted CPI trends
- Highlighted forecast ranges and potential implications for economic planning

## âœ… Key Highlights

- Applied structured data entry and cleaning using pandas and Excel
- Built a reliable forecasting pipeline to support policy analysis
- Ensured data accuracy and reproducibility across all steps
- Demonstrated proficiency in both statistical modeling and practical data handling
